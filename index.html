to do list


- ssh into the Pi (allowing me to use Atom)


- vim editor also?
- Allow users to add their own stores (ours will be github based)
- Allow users to add their own particular nodejs apps
- Create a github repository in SOS and clone it here to allow me to push changes
- find a decent text editor
